<p>This Salisbury steak recipe comes together quickly and does not need a lot of time in the slow cooker. It's a delicious way to add flavor to ground beef and the children love it! The gravy is delightful served over mashed potatoes.</p> 
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>2 pounds lean ground beef/li>
        <li>½ cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
     <li>¼ cup milk</li>
     <li>1 (1 ounce) envelope dry onion soup mix</li>
     <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
           <li>Combine ground beef, bread crumbs, milk, and onion soup mix together in a large bowl until well combined; shape into 8 patties.</li>       
           <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Dredge patties in flour just to coat, and quickly brown on both sides in the hot skillet. Place browned patties into the slow cooker stacking alternately like a pyramid.</li>
